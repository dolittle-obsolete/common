[Common tooling](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/common) represents a set of [Node](https://nodejs.org/) packages that makes up a tooling system / platform for which Dolittle tools can be built upon.
The common tooling is built in such a way that it can provide a common tool set for tools like [CLIs](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/cli) and editor extensions ([vscode](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/vscode)).
