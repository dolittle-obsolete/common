Boilerplates are node packages that are installed locally on the system (read more [here](../../packages/package_directory)). 

When the [boilerplates system](../) is initialized it discovers all installed boilerplates by finding [packages](../package) that are compatible with the [Tooling Platform](../..) and registers them as entries in a configuration file.
